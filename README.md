I'm not able to run this code due to Error: Cannot find module 'type-is'
Not much familarized with TypeORM etc I've better hands on in simpler SQL.
I don't know who to load that DB in VSCode.
Menu-SubMenu was a nice question, I got confused in writing recursive solution.
I was not able to test solutions as it was not running.

Last version I was working with accepting 'Sequelize.DataTypes.INTEGER' but I am getting syntax and reference error in code

******Yours******
Get started:

- create your own repo (for example on www.github.com)
- change the origin to your own repo with `git remote set-url origin <remote_url>`
- run `npm i` to install all dependencies
- change directory to whatever tech suites you best
- run `npm run migrate`
- run `npm run test` (1 test should succeed and 3 should fail)

Good luck! üçÄüöÄ
